Installation
============

Stable release
--------------

Python
~~~~~~

To install abess on Python, you can simply get the stable version with:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install abess

If you don’t have `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`__ installed, this `Python
installation
guide <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`__
can guide you through the process. Linux and MacOS users also need to
install `swig <http://www.swig.org/>`__.

R
~

To install stable version into R environment, run the command:

.. code:: r

   install.packages("abess")

Latest version
--------------

This page gives instructions on how to build and install abess from the
source code. If the instructions do not help for you, please feel free
to ask questions by opening an
`issue <https://github.com/abess-team/abess/issues>`__.

First of all, clone our the latest `github
project <https://github.com/abess-team/abess>`__ to your device:

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/abess-team/abess.git
   $ cd abess

Next, there have different processing depend on the programming
langulage you prefer.

Python
~~~~~~

Before installing abess itself, some dependencies should be installed
first: ``swig``, ``bash``, ``mingw``, which may be a little different in
different platforms:

-  **Linux**: ``$ sudo apt install swig bash mingw-w64`` (for Ubuntu,
   but other Linux systems are similar);
-  **Windows**: ``$ choco install swig mingw git`` (using
   `Chocolatey <https://community.chocolatey.org/packages>`__), or
   manually install the software and add them into PATH;
-  **MacOS**: ``$ brew install swig mingw-w64 bash`` (using
   `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__).

After that, you can manually install abess by conducting command:

.. code:: bash

   $ cd ./python
   $ python setup.py install --user

If it finishes with ``Finished processing dependencies for abess``, the
installation is successful.

R
~

To install the development version, run the following code in R console:

.. code:: bash

   R CMD INSTALL R-package

If it finishes with ``* DONE (abess)``, the installation is successful.

Windows user will need to install
`Rtools <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>`__ first.

Dependencies
------------

C++
~~~

Our core C++ code is based on some dependencies, which can be found in
`abess/python/include <https://github.com/abess-team/abess/tree/master/python/include>`__:

-  `Eigen <https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/releases/3.3.4>`__
   (version 3.3.4): a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices,
   vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
-  `Spectra <https://github.com/yixuan/spectra/releases/tag/v1.0.0>`__
   (version 1.0.0): a header-only C++ library for large scale eigenvalue
   problems.

They would be automatically included while installing the abess
packages.

OpenMP
^^^^^^

To support OpenMP parallelism in Cpp, the dependence for OpenMP should
be install. Actually, many compliers and tools have supported and you
can check
`here <https://www.openmp.org/resources/openmp-compilers-tools/#compilers>`__.

   What is more, if you receive a warning like “*Unknown option
   ‘-fopenmp’*” while installing abess, it means that OpenMP has not
   been enabled. Without OpenMP, abess only use a single CPU core,
   leading to suboptimal learning speed.

To enable OpenMP:

-  In Windows, `Visual
   C++ <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>`__
   or many other C++ compliers can support OpenMP API, but you may need
   to enable it manually in additional features (based on the complier
   you use).

-  In Linux, the dependence would be supported if GCC is installed
   (version 4.2+).

-  In MacOS, the dependence can be installed by:

   .. code:: bash

      $ brew install llvm
      $ brew install libomp

.. _python-2:

Python
~~~~~~

Some `basic Python
packages <https://github.com/abess-team/abess/blob/master/python/setup.py#:~:text=install_requires%3D%5B,%5D%2C>`__
are required for abess. Actually, they can be found on
``abess/python/setup.py`` and automatically installed during the
installation.

-  `numpy <https://pypi.org/project/numpy/>`__: the fundamental package
   for array computing with Python.
-  `scipy <https://pypi.org/project/scipy/>`__: work with NumPy arrays,
   and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines.
-  `scikit-learn <https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/>`__: a Python
   module for machine learning built on top of SciPy.

Furthermore, if you want to develop the Python packages, some additional
packages should be installed:

-  `pytest <https://pypi.org/project/pytest/>`__: simple powerful
   testing with Python.
-  `Sphinx <https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/>`__: develop the Python
   documentation.

   -  `nbsphinx <https://pypi.org/project/nbsphinx/>`__: support jupyter
      notebook for Sphinx.
   -  `myst-parser <https://pypi.org/project/myst-parser/>`__: support
      markdown for Sphinx.
   -  `sphinx-rtd-theme <https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-rtd-theme/>`__:
      “Read the Docs” theme for Sphinx.

.. _r-2:

R
~

The R version should be 3.1.0 and newer in order to support C++11. abess
R package relies on limited R packages dependencies:

-  `Rcpp <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html>`__:
   convert R Matrix/Vector object into C++.
-  `RcppEigen <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppEigen/index.html>`__:
   linear algebra in C++.

Furthermore, if you would to develop the R package, it would be better
to additionally install:

-  `testthat <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html>`__:
   conduct unit tests.
-  `roxygen2 <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html>`__:
   write R documentations.
-  `knitr <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html>`__
   and
   `rmarkdown <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html>`__:
   write tutorials.
-  `pkgdown <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pkgdown/index.html>`__:
   build website for the ``abess`` R package.
