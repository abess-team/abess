# Installation

## Python
- To install abess on Python, you can simply get the stable version with:

```python
pip install abess
```
- Or `git clone` our github project and install it manually:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/abess-team/abess.git
```

After cloning, `cd abess/python` and then run `python setup.py install`. If it finishes with "*Finished processing dependencies for abess*", the installation is successful.

Now you can import our package in python:

```python
import abess.linear
```
