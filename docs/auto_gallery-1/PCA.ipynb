        "## PCA\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is an important method in the field of data science, which can reduce the dimension of data and simplify our model. It actually solve an optimization problem like:\n\n..math::\n    \\max_{v} v^{\\top}\\Sigma v,\\qquad s.t.\\quad v^Tv=1.\n\n\nwhere $\\Sigma = X^TX / (n-1)$ and $X$ is the **centered** sample matrix. We also denote that $X$ is a $n\\times p$ matrix, where each row is an observation and each column is a variables.\n\nThen, before further analysis, we can project $X$ to $v$ (thus dimensional reduction), without losing too much information.\n\nHowever, consider that: \n\n- The PC is a linear combination of all primary variables ($Xv$), but sometimes we may tend to use less variables for clearer interpretation (and less computational complexity);\n- It has been proved that if $p/n$ does not converge to $0$, the classical PCA is not consistent, but this would happen in some high-dimensional data analysis.\n\n> For example, in gene analysis, the dataset may contain plenty of genes (variables) and we would like to find a subset of them, which can explain most information. Compared with using all genes, this small subset may perform better on interpretation, without loss much information. Then we can focus on these variables in the further analysis.\n\nWhen we trapped by these problems, a classical PCA may not be a best choice, since it use all variables. One of the alternatives is `SparsePCA`, which is able to seek for principal component with a sparsity limitation:\n\n..math::\n    \\max_{v} v^{\\top}\\Sigma v,\\qquad s.t.\\quad v^Tv=1,\\ ||v||_0\\leq s.\n\n\nwhere $s$ is a non-negative integer, which indicates how many primary variables are used in principal component. With `SparsePCA`, we can search for the best subset of variables to form principal component and it retains consistency even under $p>>n$. And we make two remarks: \n\n> Clearly, if $s$ is equal or larger than the number of primary variables, this sparsity limitation is actually useless, so the problem is equivalent to a classical PCA.\n\n> With less variables, the PC must have lower explained variance. However, this decrease is slight if we choose a good $s$ and at this price, we can interpret the PC much better. It is worthy. \n\nIn the next section, we will show how to form `SparsePCA`.\nReal Data Example (Communities and Crime Dataset)\n---------------------------------------------\nHere we will use real data analysis to show how to form `SparsePCA`. The data we use is from [UCI:\nCommunities and Crime Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime) and we pick up its 99 predictive variables as our samples.\n\nFirstly, we read the data and pick up those variables we interested.\n\n"
