        "## Cox Proportional Hazrds Regression\nCox Proportional Hazrds (CoxPH) regression is to describe the survival according to several corvariates. The difference between CoxPH regression and Kaplan-Meier curves or the logrank tests is that the latter only focus on modeling the survival according to one factor (categorical predictor is best) while the former is able to take into consideration any covariates simultaneouly, regardless of whether they're quantitatrive or categorical. The model is as follow:\n\n\\begin{align}h(t) = h_0(t)\\exp(\\eta).\\end{align}\n\n\nwhere,\n\n- $\\eta = x\\beta.$\n- $t$ is the survival time.\n- $h(t)$ is the hazard function which evaluate the risk of dying at time $t$.\n- $h_0(t)$ is called the baseline hazard. It describes value of the hazard if all the predictors are zero.\n- $beta$ measures the impact of covariates.\n\n\nConsider two case $i$ and $i'$ that have different x values. Their hazard function can be simply written as follow\n\n\\begin{align}h_i(t) = h_0(t)\\exp(\\eta_i) = h_0(t)\\exp(x_i\\beta),\\end{align}\n\n\nand\n\n\\begin{align}h_{i'}(t) = h_0(t)\\exp(\\eta_{i'}) = h_0(t)\\exp(x_{i'}\\beta).\\end{align}\n\n\nThe hazard ratio for these two cases is\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{h_i(t)}{h_{i'}(t)} & = \\frac{h_0(t)\\exp(\\eta_i)}{h_0(t)\\exp(\\eta_{i'})} \\\\\n                           & = \\frac{\\exp(\\eta_i)}{\\exp(\\eta_{i'})},\\end{align}\n\n\n\nwhich is independent of time.\n\n### Real Data Example (Lung Cancer Dataset)\nWe are going to apply best subset selection to the NCCTG Lung Cancer Dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/ukveteran/ncctg-lung-cancer-data](https://www.kaggle.com/ukveteran/ncctg-lung-cancer-data). \nThis dataset consists of survival informatoin of patients with advanced lung cancer from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. The proportional hazards model allows the analysis of survival data by regression modeling. Linearity is assumed on the log scale of the hazard. The hazard ratio in Cox proportional hazard model is assumed constant. \n\nFirst, we load the data.\n\n"

You can change the tunging criterion by specifying the argument `ic_type` and the support size by `support_size`. The available tuning criterion now are gic, aic, bic, ebic.
