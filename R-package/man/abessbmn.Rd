\arguments{
\item{x}{Input matrix, of dimension \eqn{n \times p}; each row is an observation
vector and each column is a predictor/feature/variable.
Can be in sparse matrix format (inherit from class \code{"dgCMatrix"} in package \code{Matrix}).}

\item{tune.type}{The type of criterion for choosing the support size.
Available options are \code{"gic"}, \code{"ebic"}, \code{"bic"}, \code{"aic"} and \code{"cv"}.
Default is \code{"gic"}.}

\item{weight}{Observation weights. When \code{weight = NULL},
we set \code{weight = 1} for each observation as default.}

\item{c.max}{an integer splicing size. Default is: \code{c.max = 2}.}

\item{support.size}{An integer vector representing the alternative support sizes.
Only used for \code{tune.path = "sequence"}. Default is \code{0:min(n, round(n/(log(log(n))log(p))))}.}

\item{gs.range}{A integer vector with two elements.
The first element is the minimum model size considered by golden-section,
the later one is the maximum one. Default is \code{gs.range = c(1, min(n, round(n/(log(log(n))log(p)))))}.
Not available now.}

\item{always.include}{An integer vector containing the indexes of variables that should always be included in the model.}

\item{splicing.type}{Optional type for splicing.
If \code{splicing.type = 1}, the number of variables to be spliced is
\code{c.max}, ..., \code{1}; if \code{splicing.type = 2},
the number of variables to be spliced is \code{c.max}, \code{c.max/2}, ..., \code{1}.
(Default: \code{splicing.type = 2}.)}

\item{max.splicing.iter}{The maximum number of performing splicing algorithm.
In most of the case, only a few times of splicing iteration can guarantee the convergence.
Default is \code{max.splicing.iter = 20}.}

\item{warm.start}{Whether to use the last solution as a warm start. Default is \code{warm.start = TRUE}.}

\item{nfolds}{The number of folds in cross-validation. Default is \code{nfolds = 5}.}

\item{newton.thresh}{a numeric value for controlling positive convergence tolerance.
The Newton's iterations converge when \eqn{|dev - dev_{old}|/(|dev| + 0.1)<} \code{newton.thresh}.}

\item{max.newton.iter}{a integer giving the maximal number of Newton's iteration iterations.
Default is \code{max.newton.iter = 10} if \code{newton = "exact"}, and \code{max.newton.iter = 60} if \code{newton = "approx"}.}

\item{ic.scale}{A non-negative value used for multiplying the penalty term 
in information criterion. Default: \code{ic.scale = 1}.}

\item{num.threads}{An integer decide the number of threads to be
concurrently used for cross-validation (i.e., \code{tune.type = "cv"}).
If \code{num.threads = 0}, then all of available cores will be used.
Default: \code{num.threads = 0}.}

\item{seed}{Seed to be used to divide the sample into cross-validation folds.
Default is \code{seed = 1}.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}
